            ### How to Create a Pre-release Tag:
            To create a pre-release tag, simply comment:

            await github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: commentBody
            });
