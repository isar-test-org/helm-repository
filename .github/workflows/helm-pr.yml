            This PR looks good to me! âœ… However, consider verifying it with a pre-release tag before merging.

            The charts that will get the new tag are:
            \`\`\`
            ${chartsList}
            \`\`\`

            > [!NOTE]  
            > Can't see a chart you edited? Make sure you changed the Chart.yaml.

            ### How to Create a Pre-release Tag:
            To create a pre-release tag, simply comment:

            \`/pre-release <tag-name>\`

            This helps ensure stability before the final release.

            await github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: commentBody
            });
